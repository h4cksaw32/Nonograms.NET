# Nonograms.NET

This is a desktop app that can be used to create or solve nonogram puzzles, written in C# using WPF.
It implements a library that I previously wrote ([NonogramLib](https://github.com/h4cksaw32/NonogramLib)).

For more information on nonograms, [read this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram).

## Requirements

Microsoft Windows with .NET 9 Runtime

## How to use

For average users, simply download the archive from the releases page, unzip it, and run the executable.

## How to develop

Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code are recommended for .sln compatibility.

Make sure you have a C#/.NET development environment set up, and fork the repository. Don't forget to pull the submodule.

## Remarks

This is my first "serious" project, so thank you very much for your interest. I know the app may be a bit janky, because I'm still learning to make projects like these.
I may add more updates and bugfixes if I find the time.
