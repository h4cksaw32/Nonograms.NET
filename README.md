# Nonograms.NET

This is a desktop app that can be used to create or solve nonogram puzzles, written in C# using WPF.
It implements a library that I previously wrote ([NonogramLib](https://github.com/h4cksaw32/NonogramLib)).

For more information on nonograms, [read this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram).
